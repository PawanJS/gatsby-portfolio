Mapty is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Leaflet library to display Map. It asks the user for location permission and displays their position on the map according to Geo-location.

The user can add workouts for running and cycling and these are stored via local storage. When a user clicks on a certain workout map is positioned according to the location.
