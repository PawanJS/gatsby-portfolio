_Who doesn’t like a fresh talent willing to learn new things with full energy & passion? Those are just a few of the skills freshers bring to the company. Many companies are skeptical about hiring freshers in the company due to high training costs & low retention of freshers, but only hiring experienced may not give you the best result you wanted for the company._

Fresh graduates have an open mind, have learned many new things during college tenure, tend to be tech-savvy, always look forward to bring positive changes in their surroundings. In the current fast-changing scenario of the corporate world, having freshers may help companies bring new ideas to the table. Here we list out 5 reasons why you should hire freshers in your organization.

**Have passion & willingness to learn**

As the saying goes “Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn”. This applies perfectly to freshers. They come with full passion & energy to show the world what they can do, how they can help the company grow and, in return, all they want is some support that helps them grow. Being a fresher means you have the least experience than anyone else, this keeps freshers open to learn new things every day from anyone. They keep looking for feedbacks & try to listen more.

**Gets trained faster**

Training freshers is considered as an important part when freshers join any company. Companies spend anywhere between 3–6 months to train freshers. Being right out of college, freshers do not have deep technical expertise & they are easy to mold by giving them access to the right tools & training. IT Companies are now moving to the agile methodology where they want to move projects quickly & easily, freshers can help in these projects as they have the right mindset to get trained & onboard in these fast-paced projects.

**Makes bulk-hiring easy**

Be it a new project being migrated offshore for an IT company or a new plant being opened for a manufacturing company, any big openings require a huge number of new employees to join the workforce. Freshers hiring through campuses proves to be the best way to tackle this. As freshers come from the same background, you can easily know what level of training would be required for them. While external hiring in huge numbers has many operational challenges — be it filtering candidates, taking interviews of people coming from different backgrounds, deciding what staff will need what training, etc.

**Freshers are Inexpensive**

Salary negotiation conversations are always hard. The company finds the right candidate, he’s a fit for the company & the role, he’s ready to move to the company as well but he’s not ready to accept the compensation offered. This happens quite often, the company wants the right candidate with the right mindset but also doesn’t want to make a dent in its pocket. What to do? — Hire freshers. The biggest advantage of fresher hiring is easy salary negotiations.

If a company is hiring from campus, then in most scenarios, salary is fixed & informed to students already. Any student, who gets selected has to accept the offerings if selected. If a company is hiring off-campus, then it can always point out the fact that as the candidate doesn’t have experience, they can’t offer him more. Freshers, being bad at these negotiations tend to accept the offer to get their first job.

**Adapts to new Technology quickly**

In this era where new technology is booming everywhere, the company also wants its staff to get adapted to these technology changes faster. As they’re young, freshers like changes. New Technology changes-be it implementing new software, adding technology layers to process workflows, or totally automating the job, all these tasks require staff adaptable to technology changes. Freshers can be of helping hand here to learn new skills & also educate other staff to understand these changes better.

Freshers hiring may have some challenges but it cannot be avoided if a company wants to grow in this fast-paced technology era. Freshers may not have any experience working in corporate but that doesn’t make them unemployable. They have got a passion to learn, they bring new energy, they like new technologies. With the right training & guidance, freshers can be transformed into successful leaders of your company.
